I currently do this via workflow by adding a dropdown menu called "frequency" that has the choices of : daily, weekly, 14 days, monthly, quarterly, bi-annually and annually.

I then set the workflow to something like "if the recurrence field equals this, then create new task (or modify task depending on if you need to keep a history of completed tasks) with the date completed + 1 day"
"if the Blank is closed/skipped (I added skipped to my status dropdown) and recurrence field equals this, then create new task (or modify task depending on if you need to keep a history of completed tasks) with the date completed/closed + 7 days" Etc.

This way, it only shows up in my task list IF I have already completed/closed/skipped one occurrence (I really do not need to see it populate tasks for perpetuity, just a reminder the next time it needs to be done). But keeps the record of what ones have been completed and which have been skipped for my records.

So far, it seems to be working but I have only two tasks that need to recur at the moment.
